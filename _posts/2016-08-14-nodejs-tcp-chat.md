Being (at least) a bit behind the times, i just got curious about Nodejs and gave it a try. I was really impressed on how 
simple it is to deploy a http server or to establish a tcp/udp connection for example.

I implemented a basic chatroom over TCP and it works pretty well with only a few lines of javascript.

Besides, parsing args and stdin is impressively easy using yargs and readline, respectively.

Here is the code on [github](https://github.com/Mathiasb17/nodejs-chatroom).
