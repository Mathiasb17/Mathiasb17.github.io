Here is my resume (as of May 2018) in [French](/files/CV_Francais.pdf).

I graduated my Ph.D. at universit√© de Poitiers (France) in december 2017. My [thesis](BROUSSET_THESE.pdf) focuses on the simulation and rendering of oceanic waves in computer graphics.

Since september 2017, i am also a software and firmware engineer in embedded systems, currently working at Itron in the field of smart metering systems.

On this website, i will publish materials about my research field and programming.
