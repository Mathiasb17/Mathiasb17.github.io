I'm a Ph.D. student in computer graphics and fluid simulation. On this website, i will publish materials about my research field, programming tricks, etc.

On my [github profile](https://github.com/Mathiasb17), you can find some projects and other stuff i like to develop on my free time.

I also love spending time solving programming challenges, here is my [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net) profile :
