Here is my resume (as of May 2018) in [French](/files/CV_Francais.pdf).

I graduated my Ph.D. at universit√© de Poitiers, France on the 7th of december 2017. My thesis focused on the simulation and rendering of breaking waves. As of september 2017, i am a software engineer in embedded systems.

On this website, i will publish materials about my research field, programming tricks, etc.

On my [github profile](https://github.com/Mathiasb17), you can find some projects and other stuff i like to develop on my free time.

I also love spending time solving programming challenges, here is my [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net) profile :
